API for Knowledge Platforms (API4KP) Reference Implementation 

Please checkout the official [Release Notes](./release-notes.md)!

## Getting Started

- **Bill of Materials** are used in a large scale projects with dozens or hundreds of dependencies, chances are multiple of them use something common internally by transitive dependencies
- Maven **Project Object Model (POM)** is an XML file that contains information and configurations (about the project) that are used by Maven to import dependencies and to build the project
- A BOM is a special kind of POM that is used to control the versions of a projectâ€™s dependencies and provide a central place to define and update those versions

## Maven Dependency Management

Please check out how Maven handles dependency management [Here](https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-dependency-mechanism.html)

> Dependency Management allows to consolidate and centralize the management of dependency versions without adding dependencies which are inherited by all children

The pom file in this project describes a lot of dependencies in dependency management section:

``` xml
<dependencyManagement>
    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>group-a</groupId>
            <artifactId>artifact-a</artifactId>
            <version>1.0.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
        </dependency>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>group-b</groupId>
            <artifactId>artifact-b</artifactId>
            <version>1.0.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>
</dependencyManagement>
```
